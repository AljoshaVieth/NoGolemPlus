# NoGolemPlus
Simple Chromium extension to remove all Golem Plus related content from the website.
# How it works
The extension just removes elements with certain classes from the website using JavaScript.
# Development
The code was mainly written by ChatGPT (Jan 9 Version).
# Install
Simply drag and drop the .crx file (can be found in the release here on GitHub) to the extension page in your Chromium browser, e.g. `vivaldi://extensions/`.
# Known bugs
* Currently, the browser displays a warning "CRX_REQUIRED_PROOF_MISSING" when downloading the .crx file. However, the extension can be installed via drag and drop without any issues.
* Sometimes, the gallery view on the main page is not being rendered properly.
